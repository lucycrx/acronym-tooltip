## Short Description (132 characters max)

Hover over acronyms on Meta internal sites to instantly see definitions from WUT and AI-generated explanations.

## Detailed Description

Acronym Tooltip surfaces definitions for internal acronyms as you browse Meta sites — no more context-switching to look things up.

**How it works:**
- Hover over any recognized acronym and a tooltip appears with the top-voted WUT definition
- If no WUT entry exists, the extension falls back to an AI-generated explanation using surrounding context
- Expand "Other definitions" to see alternative meanings ranked by votes
- Click "View on WUT" to jump straight to the full WUT page for the term

**Features:**
- Instant hover tooltips — no clicks required
- Two-tier lookup: WUT definitions first, AI fallback second
- Quick-search popup for looking up any acronym on demand
- Dismiss specific acronyms you already know so they stop appearing
- Configurable: adjust scan frequency, toggle AI fallback, manage dismissed terms
- Works on Workplace, InternalFB, Meta.com, Facebook.com, and Google Docs

**Privacy:**
- Runs only on Meta internal domains and Google Docs
- No data is sent to third-party services outside of Meta infrastructure
- All settings are stored locally in your browser
