## git commit

Always use `git` to commit small atomic units of changes. This makes it easier to revert changes in case we make mistakes or want to try different directions.

After finishing a feature or bug fix, use `git commit` to commit the changes.


## Builds

Run `./build.sh` after making changes to the source files, so that the extension is ready to be reloaded in Chrome.
